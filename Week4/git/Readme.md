In class, set up a git server with the class. This will be their homework assignment, just go through it one time with them to make sure they can do it.

The purpose of this classwork is two fold - one we get more knowledge of git. More importantly, we gain experience setting up a linux machine as a server that does stuff besides simply being a desktop pc. You see me using a laptop running ubuntu, and Linux is great as a desktop os.  I've shown you the little linux pcs I program for my other job, where Linux is an embedded OS, a little bit of logic that helps manage the functioning of an industrial device. (Bring RPi game rig to class). It can be used for gaming too. Linux is just an operating system. You will at times want to configure it as a server to host websites, or as a database server, as a proxy server, or - as we'll see now - Linux can be used as a server to host version control software.
