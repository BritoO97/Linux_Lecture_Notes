# Introduction
Bash is a relatively simple language if you compare it to something like Java. Nevertheless
the standard bash intro "Advanced bash scripting guide" available on tldp is nearly 1000 pages long!
So we are learning it piece by piece, and when you have a free week or so to read through the 
whole book you will be well prepared to skim the vast majority of it.
