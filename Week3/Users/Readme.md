# Introduction

Linux/Unix is a multiuser operating system. This may not seem revolutionary, but when Unix came out the concept of a multiuser machine was a big deal. Windows is also multiuser and macs run a verion of BSD ( like linux ) so this may not impress you. I'm going to show you how to add/remove and manage users now.
