A man goes on a long vacation and leaves his friend in charge of his house for the month he's going to be gone.
A few weeks pass and he's having a good time and doesn't check in with his housesitter. When he calls, he asks his friend how things are. Friend says "I'm really sorry to tell you but your cat's dead". He says "What?!!?! My cat died? Oh my god, how could this be?? Now I feel awful, how am I supposed to enjoy my vacation?? You're supposed to drop that bomb on me lightly don't you know?? Maynbe one day tell me my cat is on the roof and you had to go out and get him down. Then the next day you maybe tell me he must have eaten something funny up there becasue he puked. then You tell me the next day that he's eating but acting a little lethargic. Then maybe after a slow build up like this you tell me he's died!!  This is so horrible . . . Well, how's everything else?

> your mom is on the roof.
