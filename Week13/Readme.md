# Computer Security, Encryption, Cybersecurity, etc.

[ start loop test code in the background and don't mention what it is. Along the lines of "I'm just going to run this and don't you worry what it's doing."]

When you hide a key under the doormat to your house you are doing what is called "Security through obscurity". Another example of security through obscurity is using a combination lock to secure your bicycle. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity The assumption is that a nefarious party won't know the secret that you are trying to hide. In the case of your key hidden in the flower pot out back, you assume a home invader won't find the key. In the case of your bike, you're assuming the thief won't guess your three digit code - there are usually 40 digits on the front so there are 40*40*40 = not that many combinations to guess from ! Security like this either assumes your attacker is unmotivated, severely pressed for time, or has some other trivial circumstance preventing intrusion.

## ROT13
Security by obscurity generally doesn't work in the digital world. If you try to do something simple like encode a message to your class during a lecture using a simple substitution, like mapping the letters in your least favorite student's name to the letter after it, you'll get something like:

** mjovy **

Given that someone had enough time to attempt decryption with commonly used encryption schemes, they would probably get this answer. Especially on a computer, the task is trivial! What I've just shown you is an example of a *cipher*, where every character is mapped to a different character. When I say the task of deciphering is trivial to a computer, it's because computers are incredibly fast! Check out the following code that runs through the numbers 1 to one million! 

```
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  int total = 0;
  for ( int i = 0; i < million; ++i ){
    total++;
  }
  std::cout << total << std::endl;
}
```

Computers are kind of stupid, all they can do is manipulate bits - but they can manipulate bits ver, very fast! Ciphers don't stand a chance against a computer program that quickly tests combinations!

Nevertheless, ciphers, as primitive as they are, do have a place in the world. The rot13 cipher, for example, is commonly used to avoid bots. Some people [ need example ] who put their emails online will rot13 encode it so that spam bots don't see it's an email. More commonly I've seen people put "melvyniandrag [at] jee male DOT com", as this scheme is probably more resilient. 

Rot13 is "rotate by thirteen characters". [write alphabet on board and show how a -> n ]. So a maps to n, b maps to o, etc. You can use other rotation schemes too, like I showed you Rot1 at the beginning of class. Here's one way to do rot13 on the command line:

```
tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' <<< "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog"
```
Notice that there are three "<" in this command. This is an example of a "here-string". Don't worry too much about it, and if you want to know more I've put a link in the lecture notes. Anyway, you will see that T -> G, as T maps to G in the rot 13 scheme ( after z we wrap around back to a ). To decrypt rot13 is simple :

```
tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' <<< "The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog" | tee rotated_text.txt | tr 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' 'A-Za-z'
```

As an aside, this text "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a famous sentence used in schools for handwriting practice, as it features all the letters of the alphabet in english.

> Question: Are there other sentences like this used in handwriting class? I'm mainly interested in Spanish, Portuguese and Russian, but generally like learning about foreign languages. Do you have any samples of sentences like this in foreign languages?

> Question: How do ciphers handle UTF8 code points? How could you design a cipher to handle UTF8? One solution is to shift every utf point to the one after it. E.g. U+abcd -> U+abc(d+1).

## Another cool trick for cybersecurity

Before moving on I'll give one more example of why ciphers are bad! A sophisticated algorithm can use frequency analysis to decrypt a message that used a cipher. We already looked in class at how certain letters in english have been statistically shown to appear with a certain frequency. Of course, statistical analysis only holds for large bodies of text! The quick fox sentence has frequency ~1 for every letter. But, if you take the collected works of shakespeare and make a histogram of letter frequency and compare that to the histogram of letter frequencies in all the NYTimes articles written this year, you'll approximately see this [ does anyone have nice figure to give me? ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis with the letter e appearing most, followed by the letter XX followed by YY , etc. Using this technique, you could look at the bytes in a file and map the most common one to e, the second most common one to XX, etc.

> Idea for a fun hacking project - make executables that can be deciphered to be good prose following a suitable cipher/decipher scheme. 
> Idea for pygotham - do the above with Python scripts. Encode python scripts as poems using a suitable cipher. Distribute code as prose.

> Idea for class - design a lab that can be performed in ten minutes to do frequency analysis deciphering.

In any event, we've seen that ciphers are not so good for protecting sensitive data. Security through obscurity is generally not good. If anyone knows that you've simply rotated text by thirteen characters, they can decode your message. And, in some cases, they can decode even without knowing the scheme through a more subtle method like frequency analysis.

Just one more cool idea - The Russian and Ukranian alphabets have 33 letters each, and most of the letters are the same, with the exception of 3. Obviously you could tell the difference between the languages by looking to see which letters appeared, but you could also run your frequency analysis and see which were the top 3 letters in the text and decide if the text was russian or ukranian in that way!

## History of PGP, GPG, OpenPGP, GnuPG.
To learn a bit about pgp / gpg there is a great reference by a guy names "Michael Lucas" and the book is called "PGP & GPG email for the practical paranoid". In this ~200 page book he goes through the history of these tools and how to use them. I'm maybe going to save you
$25 dollars and tell you lots about what's in the book. https://nostarch.com/pgp.htm It's a good enough refernce though, if you want to pick it up and have it on your shelf. Indeed, I'm going to tell you alot tonight, and you'll learn quite a bit, but reading this book on a lazy saturday would be a great way to solidify your knowledge.

https://www.goanywhere.com/blog/2013/07/18/openpgp-pgp-gpg-difference

Published in book form to avoid legal restrictions on encryption software. There was no way to censor a book with us law. But the decision could be appealed in the future. A similar stunt was pulled by famous cryptogrpaher dan bernstein when he published an Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman algorithm via twitter: https://twitter.com/tweetnacl https://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/

## Using GPG

### Why should you know about GPG keys? 
GPG keys are used for encrypting/decrypting data and verifying the authorship/provenance of email/data. These keys are industry standards and as we mentioned, they are backed by some serious mathematics.

GPG keys are used in industry, especially in the opensource community. If you uploaded an ssh key to github for streamlining your git pushes, you may have noticed there was also an option for uploading your public gpg key. They explain here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account how to do it as well as which algorithms they support.
Furthermore, Linux kernel developers use GPG keys when making changes to the kernel. For example, you can see that Linus Torvalds has one of his keys public available on a "keyserver" here: https://pgp.cs.uu.nl/stats/17762c4676e21cbb.html . 

My gpg key can be found here:
https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/

If you search for 0xA8320558FF022DF5B6885B18FDF81434D7494435

There are various numbers on these pages and talk about signatures - we'll talk about what that stuff means now. 



# TAKE A BREAK HERE

### key vs subkey
Generally you should use the sub key for encryption/signing and not the public key. Read more in the man pages, or the summarized details in this link: https://superuser.com/questions/1371088/what-do-ssb-and-sec-mean-in-gpgs-output

## generating keys
Enough talk, let's do something now!! To generate a key you use the gpg command line tool. The tool will generate a public key and a private key - you must guard your private key with your life!! This key can be used for decrypting messages encrypted with your public key - but it can also be used to forge your signature! And the tech world generally views this signature as being an indisputable means of demonstrating that YOU are the author / creator of somethign signed with that key. So if some message on the internet shows up signed with your key, and this is an unsavory kind of message, you could be in deep trouble or at best have to jump through hoops to demonstrate that your machine was hacked and your private key taken.

```
 gpg --full-generate-key
```

This is on gpg v2.1, if you have gpg version 1.4 you will instead use the option 

```
gpg  --gen-key
```

will generate keys. It will ask you for some information. You should add a password to your key for extra security. Take time now to write your password somewhere safe and store it away. Don't ever lose this password, or you won't be able to recover your key later. This could be a security problem. At the very least you'll have a dead key floating out in the wild confusing everyone.

You need to put your name and a bit of identifying information about yourself on the key, so in case someone finds two keys with the name "Melvyn  Ian DRag" on them, they'll know the one they want is the one from the embedded Linux developer who loves dogs and not from the React Native expert who loves cats. Just a few identifying words!

You're going to want to choose RSA/RSA if it is available and use 4096 bits for your key length! The more bits the better, and I think 4096 is the upper bound now, but I'm not sure.

### Inspect public keys

Where are the keys stored? They are stored in the .gnupg directory. I believe they are generally stored in a binary format. Probably they are stored encrypted with the password you generated, though I'm not sure. I know how to get access to them though! To see all your keys type

```
gpg --list-keys
```

or

```
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

so far as I can tell these options are the same, though I'm not sure. The output looks the same to me on my debian 9 vm at work - I haven't yet tested the lecture notes out on the google cloud machine. Ultimately We'd have to look at the source  code and read documentation to verify that these options were the same. If there is time left in class we can look for the code and grep for "list-\*-keys.

If you want to see your public key you type

```
gpg --output mypubkey.gpg --export EMAIL_ASSIGNED_TO_KEY 
```

You will see a dump of binary garbage. If you want a more portable format for the key, gpg will give you the key in ASCII format. 

```
gpg --armor --output mypubkey_ascii.gpg --export EMAIL_ASSIGNED_TO_KEY
```

Issues may arise with multiple keys per email or some other complication with your export, so instead you can use the key "fingerprint".

You can get the fingerprint by typing either `gpg --list-keys` or `gpg --list-keys --keyid-format LONG` and look for an 8 byte hex number ( 16 ascii characters ).

Then output your key 

```
gpg --armor --output mypubkey_ascii.gpg --export FINGERPRINT
```

Notice in the above examples that you can output either your sub key or your pub key. The output is the same for both the pub key and the subkey. Why?

Looks to me like both the pub and sub keys are exported in this way:

```
gpg --list-packets mypubkey_ascii.gpg | grep "\(packet\|keyid\)"
```

Where did I get this --list-packets argument? Google. Why did I check the sub and pub keys and then try and find out why they are the same? Curiosity!! This is a beast of a tool and I personally will never understand how it works on a deeper than 'hand waving' level.  This tool is as much a mystery to me as it is to you, I just poke around the internet to see how to use it.

> Question: On my machine when I run ` gpg --list-keys` I get:

```
mdrag@debian:~/gpg_test$ gpg --list-keys --keyid-format LONG
/home/mdrag/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------
pub   rsa4096/FDF81434D7494435 2019-04-23 [SC] [expires: 2020-04-21]
      A8320558FF022DF5B6885B18FDF81434D7494435

sub   rsa4096/130F6ED002B64F3E 2019-04-23 [E] [expires: 2020-04-21]
```
after 'pub' I see rsa4096/FINGERPRINT and below it I see a 20 byte fingerprint. This corresponds to how many bits? [ wait for answer ] 160! Indeed that is to be expected. gpg uses a 160 bit sha-1 hash for fingerprinting your key. It generates a short, unique identifier for the key. It also shows you an 8 byte truncated version of that hash. Why? I'm not sure of the details. All of the tutorials I've seen show only the 8 byte fingerprint, but this version shows the 20 byte one as well. Why? Does your version show the 20 byte version too? Also, my "--list-keys" without the "keyid-format" doesn't even show the fingerprint as the tutorials say itshould:
https://www.debuntu.org/how-to-importexport-gpg-key-pair/

BTW I'm on:

I don't know the answer, this is an interesting research project. What's the probability of this happening? Is it > 0? i.e. is that even possible?


### Getting your key out there [ One method ]

I've shown you that Linux developers and open source folks usually have there GPG keys out in the wild for you to be able to download and use. Many people put them on keyservers, like where I put mine. But we are just playing around with these gpg keys now and I imagine you aren't very comfortable with the keys, what they are, what to do with them yet, so we're going to put the keys in a less permanent place than a keyserver, you can just put your ascii pub key on github in some file, in a new repo if you want or in your branch of the class repo. We'll use this later.

For example, mine is here: https://github.com/melvyniandrag/Linux_Lecture_Notes/blob/master/Week13/melvyniandrag.gpg

Wait for everyone to get their key online.

###  Inspecting private keys

```
 gpg --export-secret-keys emailAddress
 gpg --export-secret-keys fingerprint
 gpg --armor --export-secret-keys email
 gpg --armor --export-secret-keys fingerprint
```
You will do this is you want to take your key to another machine and use it there.

```
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys fingerprint > mysecretkey.asc
cp mysecretkey.asc /my/thumb/drive
# then take it to the other machine. I'll show you how to import the key in a bit. Jump ahead to the import key section if you want.
```

## Using `stress` while generating keys
To generate a key gpg uses some randomness in your computer to feed the key generator. I was having a hard time generating enough entropy with my keyboard, so I used the stress command. 

```
$sudo apt-get install stress
$sudo stress --cpu 4 --io 3 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 256M --timeout 400s
```
You'll need a separate tmux pane or another ssh window to run this while the generator is using the entropy.

## encrypt and decrypt
You encrypt with public keys, not with private keys. THe public key is distributed freely to the public and anyone who wants to message you will encrypt with the public key. The common imagery for thinking of a public key is an open safe that only you know the combo to. Anyone can put stuff in your safe. They close it ( encrypt it ) and then no one can open the safe but you ( with your private key ).

We will first test our encryption using our own public / private keys. Make some text. I'll write a little poem.

```
$cat robertFrost.txt
Whose woods these are I think I know
His house is in the valley though
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow

My little horse must think it queer 
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frosty lake
The darkest evening of the year
```

I think that's right. Then I'll encrypt it.

```
$gpg --output frost.encrypted --encrypt --recipient YourEmailHere robertFrost.txt
$cat frost.encrypted
#lots of binary junk
```

As with the keys you see by default the encryption outputs binary data. This is okay, but there may be certain media that interpret specific bytes as meaning something special, so it's probably safer to output ascii data. You probably remember how to do that!

```
$gpg --output frost.asciiEncrypted --encrypt --recipient YourEmailHere robertFrost.txt
$cat frost.asciiEncrypted
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
LoT5 0F AsciI DaTa h=r= 
AmiritE
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
```
It's pretty simple why you would want ASCII Data and not binary data. But maybe that only becomes obvious with experience, you may not have worked with a transport medium that would misbehave if fed certain binary data. [ Would be good to come up with a demo here maybe. Might be a waste of time.]

> Question - what ASCII characters does gpg output with the armor option? It obviously cant use the full set of ASCII characters, because things like "\f" and "\a" aren't printable. I haven't seen any ? or ! or _ in the output either, but I haven't really looked.

As before you can alse encrypt by using the fingerprint. Now I BELIEVE that gpg by default uses the subkey associated with the primary key to encrypt. I don't know what would happen if I generated multiple subkeys. I suppose I could find a way to delete my master key and leave behind only the subkey on my machine. In the link below it looks like gpg chooses the newest subkey for encryption, but I haven't verified this.

>  Question - someone explain the above to me, I'm not entirely sure about what happens. It's explained here but I haven't had time to verify everything they say on this page: https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys. At a glance it looks to me like gpg will decide which key to use in each circumstance so you don't have to worry about it. Again, I'm not sure and if anyone wants to put together a tutorial to explain to me that would be great. I'll try to know allll the details by next semester.

In any event, now that you have the message encrypted you can decrypt it.

```
$gpg --output frost.decrypted --decrypt frost.asciiEncrypted
$cat frost.decrypted
The expected data is here
```

But so far we've only encrypted/decrypted messages to ourselves using our own keys. Now you will send an encrypted message to me.
For this you need my public key. There are two ways to do this - I could give you my keyfile, or you could get it from a keyserver.
First we'll do it the keyserver way. You need to give gpg internet access by installing a package.

```
$sudo apt-get install dirmngr --install-recommends
$gpg --list-keys
# my key isn't on your keyring
$gpg --keyserver https://keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 0xA8320558FF022DF5B6885B18FDF81434D7494435
$gpg --list-keys
# now it is!
```
[Go to the keyserver and click on the fingerprint links to show that the ASCII version of the keys are stored online]

Your mission now is to write me a message, encrypt it, and then make a PR on github featuring this file:

```Linux_Lecture_Notes/Week13/EncryptedMessages/YourName.encryptedMsg```

I'll show you how first.

```
$cat myCoolMsg
Did you know that plant cells have cell walls, but animal cells don't?
$gpg --armor --output melvyndrag.encryptedMsg --encrypt --recipient melvyniandrag@gmail.com myCoolMsg
#Then go to github.com and paste the content of the encrypted message in the proper spot.
```

Now I'll decrypt a message or two and then we'll move on. If there is time I'll decrypt more messages at the end of class. 

### Exchange a message with a classmate
Find a friend in class and exchange encrypted messages to each other. Use the public keys you put on github earlier. I told you there were two ways to get keys. I showed you the keyserver method, now you're going to import your friend's key using the ascii file he or she put on github.

```
# Do the following, but dont get my key, get your friends key
$wget https://github.com/melvyniandrag/Linux_Lecture_Notes/blob/master/Week13/melvyniandrag.gpg 
$gpg --import keyfile.gpg
# now you can encrypt a message
```

Get the message to your friend however you want. Make a pr on their github repo seems like a good idea.

### Weird!
Encryption with gpg is nondeterminitstic. That's to say, if you encrypt the same file twice with the same key, the output is different. Depending on how awake you are right now, that may or may not surprise you. Try encrypting a file twice with --armor and then look at the output. It will be different. If you want to know why this is the case, you need to study a bit of cryptography. You need to know about random initial values, salts, and padding.

### Revocation certificate
[IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!] Whenever you generate a keypair you need to generate a revocation certificate. You use this to revoke your private key in the event that it is compromised. You generate a revocation cert with:

```
gpg --output revocationCert.asc --gen-revoke EMAIL_OR_FINGERPRINT_OF_KEY
```

You will save this cert to a thumbdrive and hide it somewhere very very safe. Then if your private key becomes compromised you import this into your keyring with

```
gpg --import revocationCert.asc
```

and you upload it to whatever keyservers hold your public key. Now your private key is revoked. You save this in case a terrorist gets access to your keys and goes all around saying some vile thing online you can revoke your key.

What happens if you try to use a revoked key to encrypt?

```
#works
$gpg --armor --output endian.gpg --recipient hughlie@hughlie.com --encrypt endianness.cpp
$gpg --import revocation.asc
#gonna fail
$gpg --armor --output endian.gpg --recipient hughlie@hughlie.com --encrypt endianness.cpp
gpg: hughlie@hughlie.com: skipped: No public key
gpg: endianness.cpp: encryption failed: No public key
```

Does decryption work? (yes, decryption still works)
```
$ gpg --output afterRevocation.cpp --decrypt endian.gpg 
gpg: Note: key has been revoked
gpg: reason for revocation: No reason specified
gpg: revocation comment: l

$ cat afterRevocation.cpp 
#include <cstdint>

int main(){
        uint32_t num = 1;
        char * numAddr = (char*)&num;
        for( size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(num); ++i)
                printf("0x%02X\n", numAddr[i]);
}      
```

## digital sign and verify
Apart from encrypting/decrypting, the other main use of pgp is generating documents whose provenance is irrepudiable - that there is no doubt that you generated the docuemnt. You do this by encryptijng a document with your private key so that people can use your public key to decrypt it. If you encrypt a document with a private key, the ONLY way to decrypt it is with the corresponding public key, that's why this works. 

To sign:
```
gpg --armor --output doc.signed --sign hello_world.txt 
```

To decrypt and see who it's from :
```
gpg --output decryptedMsg --decrypt doc.signed
```

You can try decrypting the secret message I put on github here:
https://github.com/melvyniandrag/Linux_Lecture_Notes/blob/master/Week13/SignedByMelvyn.encrypted

by using my public key.

## import your own secret key from a thumbdrive
Always back up your keys. Save your ascii private key on a thumbdrive and hide it. You can import it on another machine.
Read this if you want more info: https://makandracards.com/makandra/37763-gpg-extract-private-key-and-import-on-different-machine

## keyserver
I already told you where my key is, it's on the ubuntu keyserver. I've also uploaded my key to the mit keyserver, but the server is hit or miss if it's online. I always get a proxy error when using that server, and I've seen this issue documented at least on Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/pgp/comments/aorc6a/mit_lookup_fails_with_502_and_503/ This would be a big pain if you had written some script that was making curl requests to the mit server and the server was down.

### gpg vs gpg2
I've always used gpg. There is also gpg2. Admittedly I should look into gpg2 and see what it's all about. There is a description of the differences here: https://superuser.com/questions/655246/are-gnupg-1-and-gnupg-2-compatible-with-each-other but I haven't had time to look into the differences, read the docs, and make a choice if gpg2 is right for me or not. If you're interested, you could look into it. As always, there are things I don't know. If you have the time to investigate and report back with information that would be great!

## Hash vulnerabilities
We've talked about hashes several times in this class, and used md5sum and maybe discussed sha hashes, sha1 and sha256. I'd be remiss to not mention a hash vulnerability found in git a few years ago. What's the purpose of a hash? As we've seen, when you download software  - here's an example, the dragonfly bsd Operating System  https://www.dragonflybsd.org/download/ [ open link and show class ] - the software provider gives you some md5sum values to verify that the data is good. The idea is that you feed data into a hash algorithm and out comes some uniquely identifying information. But md5sum is only 128 bits! That means that there are only 2^128 different outputs possible! 

1. [128 zeros]
2. 1 [127 zeros]
3. 11 [126 zeros]
4. 01 [126 zeros ] 
5. etc.

But there is more than 2^128 possible inputs to the algorithm. So there WILL be a hash collision. FOrtunately, the collision is so unlikely that we accept the risk. A genious hacker would provide an operating system image that contained malware, but generated the same hash, and thus you would 

> Idea: Get source code for an operating system and write a virus. Then put that virus in various points of the code one by one. ( probably you want to write some software to automate this ). Compile the operating system and check the hash each time. When you get an image with the same hash, that contains your evil code, then you find a way to distribute the code in place of the original image and infect people. This would be a great little research project for someone here. As a baseline, how long does it take to loop from 1 to 2**128? 

> Question about the last idea - whats an integer datatype that contains 128 bits? 128bits = 16 bytes, so there is none. 

SEE_LOOP_TEST_CODE_NOW

I started running this code when we came into class, that was some time ago, and you will notice that it is still going. Indeed, this code will take a long time to finish. Look at your hands. If I were to let this code run to completion, and assuming the cloud machine stayed online that long, and the power plant never failed, and the computer never encountered a seg fault and needed to restart - all the flesh would be gone from your fingers, byt that time we will all be dead and long forgotten. Humanity may have ceased to exist by that point. An absolutely horrifying length of time to think about. Note that this for loop I've written is not even doing any work, it is just going through a loop. If I did a single addition in the loop the code would take twice as long. You cannot brute force an md5sum on current hardware. There are rumors of something to come in the future however . . . but lets not get off topic just yet.

 ## quantum computers and microsoft visit
I went to microsoft and learned about some cool research theyre doing ( blasphemy in a Linux class ). They are working on a quantum computer. Allegedly you can use it on azure and play with their quantum language called Q# ( like c# = microsoft java, f# = microsoft functional lang, they also have q# = microsoft quantum lang ). Not sure if its a real machine or if its an emulator of how they expect a quantum computer to work. These computers will work using quantum mechanical phenomena to do processing instead of electrical bits used by the current generation of computers. I'm not sure if this is still theoretical or if the quantum computer is going to be a real thing. Theres a lot of BS in the tech world.

They say you can rent a machine on azure( microsoft version of google cloud / AWS ). They said there is a 200 dollar credit. I'm not interested, but maybe you are. I mention this because these machines are purported to beunimaginably faster than modern computers. You see that the loop code to explore all combos of md5sums to brute force an md5sum is too slow. But on a quantum machine these brute force attacks might work and then all this gpg/ssh/md5sum/etc security you've learned in this class will be useless. Crazy to think about. What algorithms will come next? Are there any algorithms that will be resilient?

## back to shattered
HAve a look at this website too: https://shattered.io/

Show in class how two pdfs generate the same sha1 hash.

```
wget [ link to pdf1 ]
wget [ link to pdf2 ]
sha1sum pdf1.pdf
sha1sum pdf2.pdf
```

make sure to show that the pdfs are differnt in class, yet generate the same sum. Scroll through the website and show how many systems are affected by this! git, gpg, etc.

## The web of trust
Anyone can just generate a key. PGP is based on the web of trust. Key users sign each other's keys to validate that they trust each other's keys. Look at all of the signatures on Linus Torvalds' key here: https://pgp.cs.uu.nl/stats/79be3e4300411886.html

He has 87 people who verified his key and attached their name to the key. The names on that list are from fairly important people. You'll see many well known kernel contributors and you'll see linux.intel, redhat, mit, vmware and other prominent organizations in the domain names of te signer's emails.

## Let's have a quick key-signing party!

You all can organize these parties here at NJCU! I'd expect an invite if you're going to do one though! There may not be enough people around here who appreciate the sanctity of the key signing party, maybe you could find a key signing event in nyc.

How to sign keys.
https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x56.html

Example of a keysigning party, what it looks like, what you do.:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrciSbHhpBo&t=413s

Essentially get a bunch of people with their identification and key fingerprints together to verify each others' identities. THen they later sign each other's keys when at home using iinformation they wrote on paper. You don't have to sign the keys of people whose identity you doubt. This is how the web of trust is built.

>Question: The term "trust path" is used in pgp circles. What does it mean?

You use the `--sign-key` option to sign a key. You can google it for more information. I don't want to sign any of your keys tonight or have you sign mine because I don't know how serious you are about maintaining your key, I don't know if you are going to properly take care of your keys, this is your first brush with pgp. I'll sign it if you want, but I imagine some of you aren't going to use your key. If you want a signature, talk to me another day, shoot me an email.

## UNRELATED TO CYBER SECURITY
Alot of questions here about how to make it industry. Its not that hard, just keep studying. Get a degree, get an entry level job, and move up the ladder. Know how to do things. Know a couple of languages. Know algorithms and datastructures. Work on an open source project if you have time. Go to local user groups.

1. meetup.com -> look for tech meetups in NYC and go to meetings, talk to people.
2. indeed.com, monster.com, etc.
3. There are freelance sites I mentioned like upwork and freelancer - I made about 10K last year busting my hump and then owed about 4000 in taxes at the end. Not really worth it, but if you want to make a few bucks and do a few little projects I'd recommend it. Maybe check it out and see if your mileage is different.
4. give talks at conferences. At least if they accept your talk they usually give you some swag like a tshirt and they let you in for free.
> Here's an idea I had if anyone wants it, or else I'll do it. If you want to do it with help maybe we could work together ( like you do 80% of the work, I provide guidance and you put my name on the presentation ) https://github.com/alecthomas/pawk. There's a simple awk interpreter written in python. It's missing some functionality I believe. You could make it 100% awk compatible and then put some cool stuff in it and give a talk about how great awk is and whatever else you want to say. Or write a python interpreter in awk! And then use your python based awk interpreter to run your awk based python interpreter and then run a python script through it. That would be fun.
5. Work on a project. You can  publish you results on websites like isntructables.com https://www.instructables.com/member/JulianCienfuegos/ I never did anything cool, but maybe you could.

I think if you enjoy the work it shouldn't be hard. Many people hate writing software and leave the biz to do something else that they actually enjoy. There's alot to do though so you could probably find something you like. Just be ready to learn a new tool every week and sweat to meet ludicrous deadlines. I hope to have given you a taste of the software life in this class with strict deadlines, industry tools and a mixture of cool  stuff as well as annoying technical things.
