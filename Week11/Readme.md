## Useful bash tools

1. hexdump. Good reference: https://linoxide.com/linux-how-to/linux-hexdump-command-examples/ .
There are some hexdump results in this repository. As a class activity, have students decode the passages.

2. xxd. Great reference: https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/doing-reverse-hex-dump. As mentioned in the reference:
"If you work with the command line you've most likely used hexdump or od to dump binary files ...". I imagine you all have never done this, because you don't have much experience on the command line. hexdump and xxd are important tool I use almost everyday to inspect data files that may not always be ASCII encoded. xxd is like hexdump, but also allows you to undo the hexdump.
